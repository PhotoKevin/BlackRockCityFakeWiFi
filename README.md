# BlackRockCityFakeWiFi

## Purpose
Create a joke WiFi access point for Black Rock City (aka Burning Man). The person trying to use the access point gets a huge 
page of Terms and Conditions. Once they agree, they are run through several sets of questions to "Prove their not a robot". 
Finally they get told that "Dorking around on the Internet" is against the principle of Immediacy and are dumped.

## Development Environment
This is an Arduino program written for a generic ESP8266 board. The list of required libraries is maintained in the .ino file.
